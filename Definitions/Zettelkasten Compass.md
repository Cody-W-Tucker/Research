# Zettelkasten Compass

"Idea Compass Workshop" incorporating feedback from the participants using Fei-Ling "compass" approach to note taking. The concept is absolutely brilliant. Record your Atomic idea/thought/note and then ask yourself 4 different types of questions about that Atomic note that can help generate linked ideas. The compass aspect is a way to be consistent for every note you take.

**North:** The Source. Where did it originate.

**West:** What is similar.

**East:** What is opposite.

**South:** Where does this lead? (product, book, blog, YT video, call to action)

## Article

Use this method to discover the underlying context of an idea.

1. take one idea (X) and put it in the center
2. imagine the four compass directions. Each direction helps give definition to the idea in different ways.

	- **NORTH: "Where does X come from?"** what are its origin? what group/category does X belong to? what exists an order of magnitude higher? zoom out. what gave birth to X? what causes X
	- **WEST: "What is similar to X?"** what other disciplines could X already exist in? what other disciplines could benefit from X? what are other ways to say/do X?
	- **SOUTH: "Where can X lead to?"** what does X contribute to? what group/category could X be the headline of? what exists an order of magnitude lower? zoom in. what does X nurture?
	- **EAST: "What competes with X?"** what is the opposite of X? what is X missing? its disadvantage? what could supercharge X?

The purpose is to use the compass directions and the questions to guide a conversation with yourself about what you know and don't know. They are prompts to help our brains find where an idea belongs among other ideas, and related questions. Other things to keep in mind:

- Any new bullet point that comes out of an idea could be the starting IDEA of another compass session
- Something that appears in one compass direction could potentially fit in another compass direction of a totally new cluster of ideas. For example, the idea of "jobs" appeared in separate points of the exercise, and could potentially form another cluster of related ideas mostly separate from this, except for those two connections.
