# Network Theory in Artificial Intelligence

## Unified Narrative

Network Theory explores how **nodes** (entities) and **edges** (relations) shape emergent behaviour. Modern AI leverages this lens along four intertwined fronts:

1. **Representation** – Knowledge graphs, social-influence graphs, and multi-modal supply-chain networks store facts or agent states that models query, reason over, and update.
2. **Learning** – Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) generalise convolution, attention, and diffusion to arbitrary graphs, producing node/edge/graph embeddings for prediction or control.
3. **System Thinking** – Treating an AI application (multi-agent fleets, recommender engines, epidemic simulators, risk monitors) as a graph exposes cascades, robustness, and control points.
4. **Governance & Risk** – Hub-dominated (scale-free) structures enable rapid diffusion yet amplify single-point failure and bias; small-world topologies deliver resilience with short paths.

Historical milestones—Euler's bridges, Watts-Strogatz small-worlds, Barabási-Albert scale-free hubs—explain why attacks on influential social-media accounts spread quickly, while decentralised peer-to-peer learning degrades gracefully.

## Interconnections Across Topics

- **Cybernetics → Network Theory:** Every graph-aware AI that *acts* (route, recommend, quarantine) alters the network it observes, closing a feedback loop.
- **Complex Systems:** Phase-transition tools determine when misinformation "percolates" past a critical threshold.
- **Human-AI Interaction:** Exposing graph explanations ("you were recommended this because X common friends") raises transparency.

# Cybernetics in Artificial Intelligence

## Unified Narrative

Cybernetics—coined by Norbert Wiener (1948)—is the science of communication and control via **feedback**. Its influence on AI appears at three levels:

1. **Learning Feedback** – Back-prop gradients, TD-error in RL, and meta-learning function as controllers that minimise loss or maximise reward.
2. **Physical Control** – Robotics, IoT devices, and autonomous vehicles embed PID, LQR, or MPC loops from classical control theory.
3. **Socio-Technical Governance** – Audits, dashboards, and policy levers form *second-order* feedback loops in which the observer (human/regulator) is inside the system.

Micro-loops optimise performance; macro-loops regulate societal impact (e.g., EU AI Act as policy feedback).
