# Overview

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Contextual Cognitive AI (CC-AI)

### 1.1 Unified Narrative

Deep learning spots patterns; CC-AI recognizes **situations**‚Äîasking *who, where, when, why?*
It fuses:
1. **Statistical perception** ‚Üí neural nets harvest raw signals.
2. **Contextual Object Theory (COT)** ‚Üí word- & scene-sense disambiguation (bank $ finance vs bank $ river).
3. **Collaborative Cognitive Architecture (CCA)** ‚Üí humans, LLMs & IoT devices co-maintain a live context graph.

Field reports (2024): ‚Äì18 % call-centre escalations, +12 % F1 in radiology. Remaining blockers: sub-ms context churn, cultural nuance, privacy & bias drift.

### 1.2 Conceptual Overview

| Element | Methods / Assets | Example Uses | Current Gaps |
|---------|------------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Context graphs** | Neo4j, LangChain retrievers, **SOAR episodic buffer** | Retail chatbots, adaptive tutoring | < 1 s refresh, cross-cultural nuance |
| **Contextual embeddings** | Adapter-tuned LLM vectors | Multilingual help-desks | Drift, token cost |
| **Neuro-symbolic pipeline** | SOAR / ACT-R pre-filter ‚Üí rules | Fraud detection, surgical robots | Tooling maturity, rule alignment |
| **Privacy & bias guards** | Differential privacy, causal audits, **EU-AI-Act risk tiers** | GDPR dashboards | Fine-grained trade-off knobs |

### 1.3 Interconnections

- Supplies grounded predicates to SLLs.
- Delivers "situation snapshots" to Dual-Process memory.
- Generates provenance that ontology validators can trace.

### 1.4 Actionable Framework

1. **Weeks 1-2** ‚Äî Re-implement a toy sentiment model; add a *privacy scoreboard* counting user attributes accessed.
2. **Weeks 3-4** ‚Äî Build a RAG-LLM + Neo4j context graph; inject Œµ-DP noise, benchmark F1 vs Œµ.
3. **Ongoing** ‚Äî Plug in SOAR/ACT-R rules; run IBM AIF360 & causal-graph bias scans monthly.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Symbolic Logic Layers (SLLs) for Forecasting

### 2.1 Unified Narrative

Neural nets see statistical signals; SLLs add an **auditable rule-book** that lets a CFO or doctor ask "what-if?". Companies report 5-10 % better inventory turns, but **noisy predicates** can poison the pipeline‚Äîdata quality is now the #1 failure mode.

### 2.2 Conceptual Overview

| Core Item | Techniques | Deployed In | Pain-Points |
|-----------|------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Rule engines** | Prolog, DeepProbLog | Supply-chain, finance | Versioning, rule pruning |
| **Hybrid path** | LSTM ‚Üí features ‚Üí logic | Demand planning | Non-stationary regimes |
| **Explainability** | SHAP-for-rules, OWL reasoner | Climate policy sims | Predicate-noise cascades |
| **Monitoring** | Drift alerts, **nightly auto-prune** | E-commerce | Alert fatigue, latency |

### 2.3 Interconnections

- Consumes CC-AI predicates.
- Rule traces feed XAI dashboards & Dual-Process *chunking*.
- Uses ontology terms for semantic consistency.

### 2.4 Actionable Framework

1. **Week 1** ‚Äî Code basic Prolog rules; visualise fired clauses.
2. **Weeks 2-3** ‚Äî Pipe an LSTM model into the logic layer; inject synthetic noise, measure degradation.
3. **Month 2+** ‚Äî Add Logic-Tensor Nets; schedule nightly rule-prune & drift alerts.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Neuro-Symbolic Memory & Dual-Process Decision

### 3.1 Unified Narrative

Mirroring human cognition:
*System 1* (neural intuition) ‚Üî *System 2* (symbolic reasoning) with a **confidence-gate** that switches between them. Five pillars:
1. Implicit neural learning
2. Confidence-gated control (MRKL / ensemble œÉ)
3. SOAR-style *chunking* for consolidation
4. Neuro-symbolic grounding for recall
5. Sense-of-Coherence (SOC) audits for user trust

Outcome: ‚Äì35 % hallucinations, continual learning without catastrophic forgetting.

### 3.2 Conceptual Overview

| Pillar | 2024 Methods | Open Issue |
|--------|--------------|-----------|
| Confidence gate | MRKL router, ensemble œÉ | Latency tuning |
| SOAR chunking | SOAR-9 ‚Üí Prolog export | Granularity, cross-domain transfer |
| SOC audit | 3-item survey, RL reward | Cultural tuning |

### 3.3 Interconnections

- Receives live context from CC-AI.
- Fired SLL rules become new *chunks*.
- SOC scores feed governance & cybernetic feedback loops.

### 3.4 Actionable Framework

1. Read *Thinking, Fast and Slow*; run SOAR Tower-of-Hanoi demo.
2. Add a confidence-gated MRKL router to an LLM; plot latency vs accuracy.
3. Embed the 3-question SOC survey; auto-lower gate threshold if SOC < target.

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Ontologies & Knowledge Graphs (KGs)

### 4.1 Unified Narrative

Ontologies declare *what exists*; KGs link those declarations to data, providing traceability and reasoning. The key is "right-sized semantics": lightweight taxonomies for speed, heavyweight OWL when regulation demands rigour.

### 4.2 Conceptual Overview

| Aspect | Tools / Methods | Uses | Gaps |
|--------|-----------------|------|------|
| Schema design | Prot√©g√©, LinkML, SHACL | Finance, pharma | Scope creep |
| Reasoning | OWL, SPARQL, RDF2Vec | Drug repurposing, semantic RAG | Runtime cost |
| Provenance | Named graphs, **evidence-level flags** | Data mesh lineage | Cross-domain alignment |
| LLM grounding | Entity linking, prompt citations | Hallucination cut | Concept drift |

### 4.3 Interconnections

- Provides the schema that CC-AI and SLL predicates rely on.
- Entity IRIs surface in XAI dashboards and governance reports.

### 4.4 Actionable Framework

1. **Weeks 1-2** ‚Äî Model a micro-domain in Prot√©g√©; author 10 competency questions.
2. **Weeks 3-4** ‚Äî Load into GraphDB; build semantic search (sentence-embeds + SPARQL filter).
3. **Weeks 5-6** ‚Äî Ground an LLM chatbot so every answer cites ontology IRIs.
4. **Quarterly** ‚Äî Run SHACL tests; trigger **semantic-diff** alerts on each Git commit.

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Network & Cybernetic Foundations

### 5.1 Unified Narrative

AI systems live in **networks** and are steered by **feedback loops**. Graph theory spots critical hubs; cybernetics ensures stability. Ignoring either yields flash-crashes or viral misinformation.

### 5.2 Conceptual Overview

| Theme | Techniques | Example | Add-On |
|-------|-----------|---------|--------|
| Graph learning | GCN, GAT, GraphSAGE | Fraud rings | Over-smoothing |
| Temporal graphs | DySAT, TGAT | Pandemic spread | Real-time compute |
| Feedback control | PID, MPC, safe-RL | Drone stabilisation | **SOC-driven gain tuning** |
| Socio-technical loops | Dashboards, audits | EU-AI-Act compliance | Feedback latency |

### 5.3 Interconnections

- Graph hubs prioritise CC-AI context updates.
- Feedback dashboards merge SOC dips, rule-drift alerts, graph stress tests.
- Graph structure informs ontology term alignment.

### 5.4 Actionable Framework

1. Learn NetworkX; simulate hub failure on a supply-chain graph.
2. Compare PID vs Q-learning on Cart-Pole; inject sensor delay.
3. Build a dashboard merging SOC dips, rule-drift alerts & graph-centrality stress; auto-tune PID gains when SOC < 0.6.
