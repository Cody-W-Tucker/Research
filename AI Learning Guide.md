# Unified Learning Framework: From Foundations to Value-Aligned, Hybrid & Metacognitive AI

## Module 1 â€” Machine-Learning & Deep-Learning Foundations

### Unified Narrative

Machine-Learning ([[Machine Learning|ML]]) lets computers improve from data; Deep-Learning ([[Deep Learning|DL]]) extends this with multi-layer neural nets that automatically extract features. Together they underpin every later module: [[NLP]], hybrid reasoning, explainability, and ultimately [[AGI]].

### Conceptual Overview

| Core Concepts | Key Methods | Real-World Uses | Gaps / Challenges |
|---------------|-------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Supervised, unsupervised, RL | Gradient descent, decision trees, CNN, RNN, Transformer | Fraud detection, vision, speech, robotics | Bias, data hunger, interpretability, energy cost |

### Interconnections Across Topics

[[Deep Learning|DL]] provides embeddings for [[RAG]] (Module 3), perception for Neuro-Symbolic AI (Module 3) and cognitive architectures (Module 6). Explainability tools (Module 5) diagnose [[Deep Learning|DL]] models.

### Actionable Framework

1. Take Andrew Ng's [[Machine Learning|ML]] course â†’ build a spam filter (scikit-learn).
2. Complete Fast.ai's [[Deep Learning|DL]] part 1 â†’ CIFAR-10 CNN.
3. Track energy & bias metrics to prepare for Module 5.

## Module 2 â€” Natural-Language Processing & Conversational AI

### Unified Narrative

[[NLP]] equips machines to read, write and converse. Modern systems rely on Transformers (BERT, GPT), chunking documents into embeddings, and multi-turn dialogue management.

### Conceptual Overview

| Core | Methods | Uses | Gaps |
|------|---------|------|------|
| Tokenisation, embeddings, context windows | Fine-tuning, [[RAG]], RLHF | Chatbots, translation, voice assistants | Long-context reasoning, hallucinations, privacy |

### Interconnections

Embeddings feed directly into [[RAG]] (Module 3). Conversational agents become testbeds for Meta-Cognition (Module 4) and Value Alignment (Module 5).

### Actionable Framework

1. Read Ch. 1-6 of "Speech & Language Processing."
2. Fine-tune a small BERT on sentiment (ðŸ¤—).
3. Build a FAQ bot with vector search (LangChain + Pinecone).
4. Audit for bias (counter-factual tests).

## Module 3 â€” Hybrid Reasoning: [[RAG]], [[MRKL]] & Neuro-Symbolic AI

### Unified Narrative

Pure LLMs excel at language but falter on factuality and logic. Hybrid systems fix this by:

- Retrieval-Augmented Generation ([[RAG]]): fetch evidence, then generate.
- [[MRKL]]: route sub-tasks to specialised tools (calculator, API, planner).
- Neuro-Symbolic AI: entwine neural perception with symbolic rule-based reasoning.

### Conceptual Overview

| Concept | Techniques | Example Uses | Open Challenges |
|---------|-----------|--------------|-----------------|
| [[RAG]] | Embed-index-retrieve pipelines | Enterprise Q&A, medical search | Source quality, retrieval attacks |
| [[MRKL]] | Function-calling, tool routing | Data-analysis agents | Error handing, orchestration overhead |
| Neuro-Symbolic | Differentiable logic, DeepProbLog, [[knowledge graphs]] | Few-shot QA, legal compliance | Engineering overhead, scaling rules |

### Interconnections

[[RAG]] improves [[LLM]] factuality; [[MRKL]] adds tool-use; Neuro-Symbolic adds logic & transparency. Module 4's meta-layer can decide when to invoke each pathway.

### Actionable Framework

1. Implement a mini-[[RAG]] bot over your PKM notes.
2. Extend with [[MRKL]]: add a calculator tool.
3. Weekend project: CLEVR QA with DeepProbLog.
4. Evaluate with Captum + rule-trace visualiser (prep for Module 5).

## Module 4 â€” Meta-Cognitive Layers & Self-Monitoring

### Unified Narrative

Meta-cognition = "thinking about thinking." In AI it estimates uncertainty, detects drift, and decides when to ask for help or re-trainâ€”crucial for safety and user trust.

### Conceptual Overview

| Aspect | Methods | Uses | Gaps |
|--------|---------|------|------|
| Self-monitor | Bayesian heads, ensembles | Trading bots, medical triage | Fast, calibrated uncertainty |
| Self-regulate | RL meta-controller | Robotics, A/B tests | Compute overhead |
| Self-explain | Chain-of-thought prompting | Tutoring, clinician reports | Faithful vs. post-hoc |

### Interconnections

Acts as a supervisor over Modules 2 & 3; supplies monitoring hooks for Explainability (Module 5) and Alignment (Module 5).

### Actionable Framework

1. Add deep-ensemble uncertainty to your Module 2 classifier.
2. Trigger human review if confidence < Ï„.
3. Measure latency, accuracy, user trust.

## Module 5 â€” Explainability, Governance & Value Alignment

### Unified Narrative

[[xAI|Explainable AI]] converts black-box behaviour into human-readable artefacts ([[SHAP]], [[DeepLIFT]]-2, attention maps, counterfactuals). Value-aligned design layers universal ethics (Existential Layer) and personal context ([[Living Document]]) on top, ensuring culturally-sensitive, policy-compliant outputs.

### Conceptual Overview

| Pillar | Tools | Uses | Challenges |
|--------|-------|------|-----------|
| Attribution | [[SHAP]], [[DeepLIFT]]-2 | Credit scoring, toxic-post triage | Compute, correlated features |
| Focus | Attention, Grad-CAM | Vision-language QA, multimodal sentiment | "Attentionâ‰ Explanation," privacy |
| Counterfactuals | LIME, DICE | Loan appeals, content takedown recourse | Plausibility |
| Value Layers | Constitutional prompts, rule checkers | Harmless chat, ethical policy bots | Value conflicts, rigidity |

### Interconnections

Outputs feed Meta-Cognition (Module 4) and inform Neuro-Symbolic rules (Module 3). [[Living Document]] personalisation loops back to Conversational AI (Module 2).

### Actionable Framework

1. Compute [[SHAP]] on your [[RAG]] bot; redact PII with DP-clipping.
2. Write a 1-page personal value hierarchy; encode as rules.
3. Chain: [Input] â†’ [[RAG]] â†’ [[MRKL]] tool â†’ Existential Layer veto â†’ [[SHAP]] summary.
4. Draft an "Explanation Card" for auditors.

## Module 6 â€” Cognitive Architectures & Reality-Monitoring

### Unified Narrative

[[CRMN]], [[CLARION]], [[ACT-R]] and [[SOAR]] model how humans integrate perception, reasoning, memory and goals. They inspire AI systems with hybrid representations and meta-cognitive watchdogs that can detect hallucinations and plan hierarchically.

### Conceptual Overview

| Architecture | Key Idea | Signature Technique | Use Case | Challenge |
|--------------|----------|--------------------|----------|-----------|
| [[CRMN]] | Reality-gating Mixture-of-Experts | Gating nets | Hallucination filter | Calibrating "what's real" |
| [[CLARION]] | Dual-process (implicit + explicit) | Rule induction + NN | Social robots | Scalability |
| [[ACT-R]] | Production rules + subsymbolic costs | Conflict resolution | Intelligent tutoring | Parallel goals |
| [[SOAR]] | Goal-driven chunking planner | Hierarchical decomposition | NASA mission sims | Knowledge engineering |

### Interconnections

[[CRMN]] provides hallucination checks for Module 3's hybrid agents. [[CLARION]]'s explicit rules dovetail with Neuro-Symbolic logic; [[ACT-R]]/[[SOAR]] planners can be wrapped as [[MRKL]] tools.

### Actionable Framework

1. Implement a toy [[CRMN]] gate to reject GPT hallucinations.
2. Run the [[ACT-R]] Stroop demo; inspect rule firings with [[SHAP]]-style trace.
3. Embed [[SOAR]] planner in [[MRKL]] agent for complex tasks (e.g., calendar + travel).

## Module 7 â€” Toward Artificial General Intelligence ([[AGI]])

### Unified Narrative

[[AGI]] aspires to human-level breadth across perception, reasoning, planning and self-reflection. A plausible roadmap integrates:

- Hybrid reasoning (Module 3)
- Meta-cognition (Module 4)
- Value alignment & governance (Module 5)
- Cognitive-architecture scaffolds (Module 6)

### Conceptual Overview

| Capability | Current Technique | Demo | Unknowns |
|------------|-------------------|------|----------|
| General learning | Foundation models | GPT-4 tool-use | Robust domain shift |
| Unified memory & reasoning | Neuro-symbolic stacks | AlphaCode | Long-term consistency |
| Self-reflection | Meta-cognition, constitutional AI | Claude self-critique | Formal safety proofs |
| Embodied agency | Sim2Real robotics | Gato arm | Safe open-world explore |

### Interconnections

Modules 1-6 supply the building blocks; [[AGI]] is the integrative layer that must keep them value-aligned and explainable.

### Actionable Framework

1. Build a personal [[AGI]] "mini-assistant":
	 [[LLM]] (Module 2) + [[RAG]] & [[MRKL]] (Module 3) + Meta-monitor (Module 4) + Existential Layer (Module 5).
2. Enrol in Berkeley CS-294 (AI Safety) & join an alignment reading group.
3. Open-source a benchmark that tests hybrid + meta + alignment in one loop.
